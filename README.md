"#Swim-Meet-Signup" Develop a website for Arcadia Riptides Swim Club that does the following: 1. Extract the event information from the Event List pdf file and put it on a web site. 2. Parents go to the web site and click the event(s) their kids are going to sign up. 3. Behind the scene, the head coach has “pre-defined” a set of events for each kid. For example, an eight years old kid can sign up a 50 feet breast stroke event but cannot sign up a 1500 feet breast stroke event because it is too hard for an eight years old kid to swim 1500 feet. 4. By the sign-up deadline, the head coach generates a pdf and csv files listing all the events all the kids have signed up and the associate fees.
